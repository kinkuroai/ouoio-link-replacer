# Ouo.io Link Replacer

This Tampermonkey userscript automatically replaces all instances of `ouo.io` in website links with `ouo.press`. This is particularly useful for users who encounter outdated `ouo.io` links instead of `ouo.press`.

## Features

*   **Automatic Link Replacement:** Replaces `ouo.io` with `ouo.press` in all links on a webpage.
*   **Dynamic Content Support:** Uses a MutationObserver to detect and replace links in dynamically loaded content. This ensures that links are replaced even after the initial page load.
*   **Simple and Lightweight:** Efficiently replaces links without impacting browser performance.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Compatible with any browser that supports Tampermonkey (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
